CombStruct4Lean is a benchmark of 383 formalized combinatorics problems in the Lean 4 proof assistant, sourced from high-school olympiad-level math competitions. Unlike existing datasets, CombStruct4Lean emphasizes the creation and use of problem-specific combinatorial structures, making it particularly challenging for both autoformalization and automated theorem proving tasks. The benchmark is built using an iterative LLM-guided pipeline with semantic and human verification, providing a realistic setting for evaluating formal reasoning in combinatorics.
